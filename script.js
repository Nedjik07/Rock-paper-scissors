    // We then will use Math.float() to float to the precedent digit
    // Then since it include 0 we will have 9 possibilities
    // We can then divide by 3 -> 0-2, 3-5, 6-8
    // If the number is between 0-2 choose Rock, if between 3-5 choose Paper...Accordingly with scissor
    // Return the value
